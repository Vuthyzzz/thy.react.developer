            This website was built to showcase my background profile (version
            1.1.1). It’s a basic site made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I
            deployed it on GitHub and Vercel. Soon I will update it to a new
            template that looks more modern and cool when people visit.

            I tested and built a website inspired by Phillip Bank to improve my
            front-end development skills. This project helped me practice
            responsive layouts, modern design, and organizing real bank-like
            content. By building it myself, I learned more about UI/UX,
            structure, and how to present financial services clearly and
            professionally.
